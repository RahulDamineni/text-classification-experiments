Used 25k reviews from standard IMDB dataset on various models to predict if a given review is positive OR negative.

## What all models have been tried? ##

* **Simple 1D convolution model**: Passes whole review as a sequence to match a binary output.
* **Simple RNN model**: Passes whole review as a sequence to learn a review embedding which predicts a binary output.
* **Attention RNN model**: This time, the model learns which part of review embedding contributes how much to predict output.
* **Hierarchial RNN model**: Breaks the review into sentences and learns sentence embedding first and then uses them to learn review embedding. 
  Also tries to predict a binary output.
* **Hierarchial Attention RNN model**: Understands Reviews as list of sentences (sentence embeddings) and learns what sentences weigh how much to
  the final score of predicting whether if a review is positive or negative.
